# LoRa++

Small, flexible LoRa module designed for HAB use as well as general 
long distance comms.

Features:
 * SX1276 LoRa transceiver
 * Same PCB can be used for 434MHz, 868MHz and probably other 
frequencies (different components required)
 * MMZ09312 PA for >27dBm output power (for 869.525MHz use in EU). 
Optional, can be bypassed with 0 ohm resistors if not needed.
 * SAW filter and MAAL-010704 LNA (also optional) in receive path 

Note: this is still in the fairly early design phase; the PCB design has 
not yet been checked or built.
